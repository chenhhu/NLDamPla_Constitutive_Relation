Analytical solution of our nonlocal continuum damage-plasticity model in Chen et al., 2024, Journal

This code is developed to give the analytical solution of our nonlocal continuum damage-plasticity model, see Chen et al., 2024 (J).


Various loading pathes:

(1) Uniaxial compressive loading, test data-Karsan and Jirsa, 1969; Kupfer, 1969

(2) Biaxial compressive loading, test data-Kupfer, 1969

(3) Conventional triaxial compressive loading, test data-Walton et al. 2017;  Yang et al. 2008
