Analytical solution of our nonlocal continuum damage-plasticity model in Chen et al., 2024, Journal

This code is developed to give the analytical solution of our nonlocal continuum damage-plasticity model, see Chen et al., 2024 (J).

Stress state: Uniaxial compressive stress

Material: concrete, see Karsan and Jirsa, 1969
